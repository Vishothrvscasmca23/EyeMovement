EYE MOVEMENT

To move the eyes as we move the mouse, we need to first get the x and y positions of the mouse. The basic logic here is that we will add a mousemove event listener to the window. Then, we will use the event,pageX or event. pageY property to get the X or Y coordinate at which the mouse was clicked.
